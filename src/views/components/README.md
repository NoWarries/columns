# Component locations

- Components used for rendering as a '*Column Component*' are placed within `/components/content/` this is the **content** of the website.
- Components used for rendering, any component that is **not** used as 'content' is placed in `/components/website/`

If a component is used as both content and for the website it is supposed to be placed in `/components/content/` regardless. (This scenario is not desirable)
